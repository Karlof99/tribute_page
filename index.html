  <div id="tribute-info">

    <p><b>1892</b> Born in Chiautla Puebla.</p>
    <p><b>1910</b> At age 17, he took up arms in the Mexican Revolution under the command of Aquiles Serdán Alatriste, the first martyr of the Revolution.</p>
    <p><b>1935</b> He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1935.</p>
    <p><b>1938</b> He was the director of the government owned newspaper, El Nacional.</p>
    <p><b>1939-43</b> Bosques was stationed in France, coinciding with most of World War II, initially as Mexico's Consul General. Fleeing the German occupation of Paris in May 1940, Bosques was instructed by his government to organize a consulate to represent Mexico in Vichy France, which he set up in Marseille. Once Nazi Germany had occupied France and entrusted much of the governance of the country to Vichy France, he directed consular employees to issue a visa to anybody wanting to flee to Mexico. Under his auspices, visas were issued to approximately 40,000 people, mostly Jews and Spaniards. The Spaniards rescued were refugees from Francoist Spain after the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War in April 1939. Bosques rented a castle and a summer holiday camp in Marseilles to house refugees under the protection of what he maintained was Mexican territory under international law.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
    <p><b>1943</b> Bosques, his family (wife and three children), and 40 consular staff members were arrested by the Gestapo and detained in a "hotel-prison"<sup>[2]</sup> in Germany for a year. He was released under an agreement between the German and Mexican governments after Manuel Ávila Camacho (then President of Mexico from 1940–46) made an exchange of prisoners with imprisoned German citizens.<sup>[3][2]</sup>
    <p><b>1944</b> Gilberto and his family returned to Mexico.</p>
    <p><b>1946-1964</b> Ambassador and consul in Portugal,   Finland, Sweden and Cuba (in this country from 1953 to 1964).</p>
    <p><b>1962</b> During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bosques — who was both a personal friend of Fidel Castro and the diplomatic representative of a neutral country trusted by the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba, worked to facilitate communications between the disputants and bring Cuba into agreement with the "face-saving" agreements worked out between the two nuclear powers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p><b>1995</b> Died in Mexico City at the age of 102.</p>
